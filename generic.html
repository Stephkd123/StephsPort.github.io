								<p><b>I am a data science specialist with a passion for transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive decision-making. Enrolled in a master’s degree in information systems and technology, concentration in data science and Analytics at Claremont Graduate University (Graduating May 2025), I have developed a strong foundation in SQL, Python, machine learning, and data engineering—skills that I have applied in real-world projects and internships.
                                                                   With experience as a Data Science Intern at LifeNet Health, I worked extensively with Azure SQL databases, also collaborating with a strong team of professionals, using different team strategies to prepare and clean medical data for analysis, and towards the end of the project duration, we get to use data visualization to communicate our findings on tissue suitability predictions, and understanding processes in tissue recovery correlating with tissue suitability to stakeholders. My work in data analysis, and ETL pipeline development demonstrates my ability to work across diverse industries, tackling complex problems with data-driven solutions.
							           Beyond technical expertise, I bring strong people skills, developed through my role as a Teaching Assistant in Database Management, where I worked with graduate students in mastering SQL and database design. My ability to communicate complex data insights in an understandable and actionable manner makes me an asset to any data-driven team.
							           Outside of work, I am a dedicated soccer fan and player, always finding time to enjoy the sport that has taught me teamwork, strategic thinking, and perseverance. I also have a keen interest in video games, particularly those that challenge problem-solving and critical thinking—skills that I bring into my analytical work.
