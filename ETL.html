                                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                                <h4>Focus: Applied Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Feature Engineering </h4>
                                <h4>Tools: Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression </h4>
                            </header>
                            
                    <p>This project is a collaborative applied machine learning initiative focused on <b>classifying donor tissue suitability</b> using large, relational healthcare datasets. <br>
                        The objective was to translate complex donor, tissue, and agency-level data into <b>interpretable predictive models</b> capable of supporting data-driven decision-making in tissue suitability assessment.</p>

                            <h3>The project addressed three core analytical questions:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Which donor and tissue characteristics are most predictive of tissue suitability?</li> 
                                <li>How does agency-level behavior and performance influence suitability outcomes?</li> 
                                <li>Can machine learning models reliably classify tissue suitability using engineered clinical and operational features?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Data Engineering & Preparation</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <p>I led the SQL and ETL pipeline, extracting and transforming data from multiple relational database tables to produce an analytics-ready dataset at the donor–tissue grain. This involved:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Designing and optimizing complex SQL joins and pivots across donor, tissue, and characterization tables.</li> 
                                <li>Ensuring data integrity while scaling to ~68,000+ records, representing the final analytical dataset.</li> 
                                <li>Standardizing temporal variables (e.g., converting mixed time units to minutes or years).</li>
                                <li>Handling missing values and outliers using domain-informed rules rather than blanket row deletion.</li> 
                                <li>Creating derived features such as donor tissue counts, agency stratifications, and ischemic time indicators.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>The result was a clean, reproducible dataset supporting both exploratory analysis and modeling.</b></p>

                            <h3>Feature Engineering & Analytical Design</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <p>Significant effort was invested in feature engineering to capture real-world behavior and trends, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Agency-level performance metrics (e.g., suitability rates, normalized agency scores).</li> 
                                <li>Binary and categorical encodings to preserve interpretability while enabling model compatibility</li> 
                                <li>Domain-informed thresholds to retain underrepresented agencies without introducing bias</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>These features enabled both predictive performance and explainability, which is critical in healthcare analytics contexts.</b></p>

                            <h3>Machine Learning Modeling</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <p>Multiple supervised learning approaches were evaluated to balance accuracy, robustness, and interpretability:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Logistic Regression (baseline interpretability).</li> 
                                <li>XGBoost</li> 
                                <li>Association Rule Mining for pattern discovery</li>
                                <li>Random Forest</li> 
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation and appropriate classification metrics, with feature importance and association rules used 
                                to surface actionable insights rather than black-box predictions.<br>
                                         Data restricted due to Data compliance Agreements
                            </b></p>
                            <p>Each team member independently explored modeling strategies, promoting robustness through comparative experimentation and reducing confirmation bias.</p>
