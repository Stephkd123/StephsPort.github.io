                    <p>AI assistant for University students, staff, and alumni: This is an AI-powered agent, developed in collaboration with a team of graduate students and professors at the Center for Information Systems and Technology (CIST) department. The chatbot, named FlameAI, was designed to enhance campus engagement and accessibility by providing real-time, structured responses to inquiries related to Claremont Graduate University. Built using Streamlit, OpenAI's GPT-4o, LangChain, and the Tavily Search API, FlameAI integrates live search capabilities and custom prompt engineering to deliver accurate, up-to-date information about academic programs, student services, events, administrative resources, and more.
                        The project showcases applied skills in generative AI, conversational design, and full-stack development. As part of its architecture, the chatbot employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, vector-based search tools, and prompt chaining for structured responses. It also features a user-friendly web interface and was developed with scalability and future customization in mind. FlameAI represents a meaningful step toward integrating responsible AI into educational institutions and reflects my interest in building impactful AI systems that improve access to information and user experience.
